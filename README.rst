Why?
----

Most LDAP solutions for Python and/or Flask focus in being generic LDAP
interfaces. It's up to the developer to understand and work around the
quirks of Active Directory. This module aims to reduce the complexity
and development time for Python-powered applications that securely
interface with Active Directory.

Features
--------

-  Python 2 and 3 support
-  Unicode support
-  Authenticate user credentials via direct bind
-  Quickly test if a user is a member of a group, including nested groups
-  Query user and group attributes
-  Simple user and group search
-  Get all groups that a user is a member of, including nested groups
-  Get a list of all group member users, including from nested groups
-  Options to automatically convert binary data into base64 for JSON-safe
   output


Installing
----------

First, install the system dependencies

::

    $ sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python3-dev python3-pip libldap2-dev libssl-dev

Then

::

    $ sudo pip3 install -U easyad

Example uses
------------

::

    from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function

    from getpass import getpass
    from json import dumps

    from easyad import EasyAD

    # Workaround to make input() return a string in Python 2 like it does in Python 3
    # It's 2016...you should really be using Python 3
    try:
        input = raw_input
    except NameError:
            pass

    # Set up configuration. You could also use a Flask app.config
    config = dict(AD_SERVER="ad.example.net",
                  AD_DOMAIN="example.net",
                  AD_CA_CERT_FILE="myrootca.crt")

    # Initialize all the things!
    ad = EasyAD(config)

    # Authenticate a user
    username = input("Username: ")
    password = getpass("Password: ")

    local_admin_group_name = "LocalAdministrators"

    user = ad.authenticate_user(username, password, json_safe=True)

    if user:
        # Successful login! Let's print your details as JSON
        print(dumps(user, sort_keys=True, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))

        # Lets find out if you are a member of the "LocalAdministrators" group
        print(ad.user_is_member_of_group(user, local_admin_group_name))
    else:
        print("Those credentials are invalid. Please try again.")
        exit(-1)

    # You can also add service account credentials to the config to do lookups without
    # passing in the credentials on every call
    ad.config["AD_BIND_USERNAME"] = "SA-ADLookup"
    ad.config["AD_BIND_PASSWORD"] = "12345LuggageAmazing"

    user = ad.get_user("maurice.moss", json_safe=True)
    print(dumps(user, sort_keys=True, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))

    group = ad.get_group("helpdesk", json_safe=True)
    print(dumps(user, sort_keys=True, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))

    print("Is Jen a manager?")
    print(ad.user_is_member_of_group("jen.barber", "Managers"))

    # The calls below can be taxing on an AD server, especially when used frequently.
    # If you just need to check if a user is a member of a group use
    # EasyAD.user_is_member_of_group(). It is *much* faster.

    # I wonder who all is in the "LocalAdministrators" group? Let's run a
    # query that will search in nested groups.
    print(dumps(ad.get_all_users_in_group(local_admin_group_name, json_safe=True)))

    # Let's see all of the groups that Moss in in, including nested groups
    print(dumps(ad.get_all_user_groups(user), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))
